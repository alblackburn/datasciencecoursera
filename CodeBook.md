# Transformations to raw data resulting in tidy dataset
* The raw test data and training data were bound together into a single data frame using rbind()
* The variable names were extracted from the features.txt file using only the second column. These names were then input as column names to the dataset.
* Any duplicate column names were made unique using the names(dataset[,]) function
* Only column names with the characters "mean" or "std" were gathered using the dplyr grep function, and then filtered out using the dplyr select(one_of()) function.
* Columns were added to the dataset from the y_test.txt/x_test.txt files and the subject_test.txt/subject_train.txt files, to add variables for the Activity name and Subject ID, respecively. Appropriate column names were added.
* Activity names and subject IDs were bound to the data set using cbind()
* Activity numbers were substituted for the appropriate activity names, using gsub()
* The remaining column names were renamed to be more descriptive, using gsub()
* The dataset was grouped by subject ID, then by activity, using the group_by() function.
* These groups were then summarized by mean, using the summarize_each_() function.
* This final dataset was written to local file using the write.table() function.
